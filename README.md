This is DualDriveBurstBackup - a parallel cable copier designed for dual drive use.

Here is how you build it for one drive: http://sta.c64.org/cbmpar.html

Interface is simple - connect wires from the two cables each to each.
As for my knowledge this is the fastest copier ever. I mean real time of copying,
it is not faster than other burst copiers, but removing necessity of swapping disks
saved much more time than fiddling in code in search of missing cycles.
